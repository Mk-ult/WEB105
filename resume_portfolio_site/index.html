        <p id="p1">Art is a great hobby for me. It actually started out simply because I felt like coloring, but I wanted to color something that I personally drew.
            Over the years my style has certainly evolved and you can see the progression of how I first started to where I am now. But personally, for me, Art has never really been
            about being good or bad. I wasn't making it for anyone else, I just wanted to create something and color. Many of my pieces, I spent upwards of 90+ hours
            working on, over the span of several months. It taught me alot of patience, watching these pieces slowly but surely come to life. Besides the coloring,
            I really enjoy the process of drawing in and of itself. When im working on a piece, i'm in the completely in the moment, carefully making each line, no distractions,
            or wayward thoughts. It's a very relaxing and calming experience for me.
