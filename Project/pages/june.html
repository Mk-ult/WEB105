            <p>So June is my best friend's sister's dog. I was there the day she came home with her. Just a tiny ball of black fur with giant round eyes peeking out. Now, naturally as I was over at my friends house quite often over the years. I got to see June grow-up and I know she couldnâ€™t wait to see me anytime I would come over. I know this because the minute I sat down and June heard me, she would boop her way through whatever doors were in her way, to come find me. And even though she had far outgrown the size to comfortably fit on anyone's lap, she would slowly and carefully climb onto my lap, no regard for the size of the chair or limited space. But after finally getting onto my lap, I would hug her and pet her. But she would not calm down until she could get into my lap. Everyone knew when I got there, to just let June find me, hug me, get it all out of the way and then she would go do her own thing
