            <p>This big baby is Nugget. Though pitbulls often have a terrible stereotype as being overtly aggressive dogs, Nugget couldn't be further from that stereotype. 
                Belonging to yet ANOTHER friend, this adorable cutie pie loves nothing more than to run in circles and destroy toys. Though those may be his top favorite activities, Nuggy also enjoys watching TV especially with other dogs in it. Maybe too closely even, as he sits as close as he literally can to the screen. He is a huge fan of Air Bud by the way. I saw Nugget just a few weeks ago, 
                he ran circles around me with one of his new toys in fact, all the while getting pets.</p>
