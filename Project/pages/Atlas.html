        <p>Top of the page. Mr. Big Dog. Atlas is an absolute unit of a rottweiler. My brother and I got Atlas from our half-sister around 2 years ago. He’s the first dog that I’ve ever actually owned. Or co-owned, I suppose. But I was always just loving other people's dogs. Which by no means is a bad thing. You literally get to play with them, give them scratches, treats, and you don’t even have to pick up after them. It is fantastic. But there's nothing like having your own dog. Now while Atlas may look like a big beast. But he’s honestly just a giant baby. Willing to sprawl out right on top of you if you would let him. Although he loves to lick cement and eat dirt, he’s incredibly obedient and has nothing but kisses to give out.
